Authentication
==============

### Access Tokens

You can use access tokens to authenticate as any user in the system.
Currently, there are two ways to get an access token:

  * Tokens may be created manually by the user and then given to
the third party for use.  Access tokens can be generated from the user's
profile page.
  * Tokens can be created automatically from third-party apps by
    following the <a href="oauth.html">OAuth2</a> flow.

Note that all requests will need the
"access_token" query parameter set, not just the first request.
Most API calls will only return data that is visible to the
authenticated user.  For example, to list the courses that
your user is enrolled in as a teacher:

    $ curl https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses.json?access_token=USER_PROVIDED_ACCESS_TOKEN | jsonpretty
    [
      {
        "name": "First Course",
        "id": 123456,
        "course_code": "Course-1",
        "enrollments": [
          {
            "type": "teacher"
          },
          {
            "type": "ta"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Second Course",
        "id": 54321,
        "course_code": "Course-2",
        "enrollments": [
          {
            "type": "teacher"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

### HTTP Basic Auth

*This authentication approach is deprecated*

You can use HTTP Basic Auth to authenticate with any username/password
combination. Note that all requests will need the Authentication header,
not just the first request. All API requests using Basic Auth will need
to include an API key (developer key) as well. Most API calls will only
return data that is visible to the authenticated user. For example, to
list the courses that your user is enrolled in as a teacher:

    $ curl -u 'YOUR_USER:YOUR_PASS' \
      https://canvas.instructure.com/api/v1/courses.json?api_key=DEVELOPER_API_KEY | jsonpretty
    [
      {
        "name": "First Course",
        "id": 123456,
        "course_code": "Course-1",
        "enrollments": [
          {
            "type": "teacher"
          },
          {
            "type": "ta"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "Second Course",
        "id": 54321,
        "course_code": "Course-2",
        "enrollments": [
          {
            "type": "teacher"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]

API Keys
--------

When using HTTP Basic Auth, all requests will require a developer API
key to be sent with the request data. Contact your Canvas LMS
administrator to request an API key. The developer key is not required
when using an access token.

The API is a work in progress, and the web UI for managing API keys is
still in development. If you are running your own Canvas LMS instance,
you will need to generate an API key from the Rails console:

    $ script/console
    > key = DeveloperKey.create!(
        :email => 'your_email',
        :user_name => 'your name',
        :account => Account.default)
    > puts key.api_key

The value of `api_key` is the token you'll need to send with every
request, for example:

    /api/v1/courses.json?api_key=YOUR_KEY

If you have trouble getting your Rails console to start, please see the
Rails console section on our <a href="https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms/wiki/Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting wiki page</a>.
